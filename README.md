### About this Repository

Welcome to my GitHub Practice repository, where I document my journey of learning and practicing JavaScript, React, Unit Testing, Web Security, and more! Here, you will find a collection of code snippets, projects, notes, and resources that I have accumulated. My goal with this repository is not only to improve my skills but also to share my knowledge with others who are also interested in these topics.

## Projects

1. **Landing Page** - ([Live Demo](https://ash1eygrace.github.io/practice/projects/landing-page/) / [Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/projects/landing-page)) This project is a simple landing page created with HTML, CSS, and Flexbox as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It was a simple project to get familiar with everyday developer tools like VSCode, Git and GitHub, and CLI while building knowledge in HTML and CSS. 
2. **Registration Form** - ([Live Demo](https://ash1eygrace.github.io/practice/projects/registration-form/) / [Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/projects/registration-form)) This project is a fully responsive registration form with client-side validation. Client-side validation is excellent for UX; However, since JavaScript can be disabled and bypassed, validation and sanitization must happen serverside to protect the database from malicious injections. This project aimed to build fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web security.
3. **Planet Components** ([Live Demo](https://ash1eygrace.github.io/practice/react/component-rendering-exercise/index.html) / [Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/projects/component-rendering-exercise)) In this mini React project, the goal was to dynamically generate components on page by mapping over data in an array of objects vs. displaying them statically. 
4. **Scoreboard** - ([Live Demo](https://scoreboard.ash1eygrace.com/) / [Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/projects/scoreboard)) This project explored important concepts in React, such as component hierarchy, state management, prop passing, and breaking down the UI into a modular component hierarchy to make a codebase that's accessible and maintainable. Through effective state management, I avoided common pitfalls such as memory leaks. Additionally, I gained experience in passing props between components without triggering unnecessary re-renders. I deployed this project to Netlify directly from its GitHub repo. 
5. **Giphy Search React App** - ([Live Demo](https://giphy.ash1eygrace.com) / [Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/projects/gif-search-react)) This project uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/example) and Giphy's API [search endpoint](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#search) to enable users to search for and display GIFs. By working on this project, I gained expertise in avoiding race conditions when waiting for API responses and understanding the difference between fetch() and Axios. I also became familiar with React Dev Tools, which allowed me to customize the data displayed in the app by viewing the full API response. This project was built locally and manually deployed via Netlify. 


## Miscellaneous:  

- **React** - ([source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/react)) this a collection of projects to practice React basics like rending components, practicing state, and mapping over data to dynamically display commponents. 
- **Tampermonkey Scripts** - ([source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/projects/tampermonkey-scripts)) This a collection of Tampermonkey scripts I created to make the UX better for daily work. 
- **Javascript** - ([Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/javascript)) here I've practiced various things like array-object-methods and displaying the date and time using JavaScrit. 
- **Jest Testing** - ([Source](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/practice/tree/main/jest-testing)) this is a collection of Javascript code snippets and corresponding Jests tests I complete while working through TOP's Test Driven Development Lesson.

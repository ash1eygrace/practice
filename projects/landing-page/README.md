## About this Project

This project is a simple landing page created with HTML, CSS, and Flexbox as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. 

This is a small project designed to have the learner strategically break a solution down into small bits, think about when to commit, get familiar with Git, GitHub, and other tools to build a workflow and muscle memory. 

## Learning outcomes

- Learning to commit early & often. 
- Becoming familiar with real-world tools. 
- Breaking a large project into small chunks.

## Tools used

- Git
- Visual Studio Code
- Terminal (Bash)
- GitHub
- Chrome's Browser Dev Tools

## The Objective:

The objective was to create a landing page on a topic you're interested in. Then add relevant copy and images. 

Since my goal isn't to become a designer, I decided just to clone the provided screenshot mockup and styles that TOP supplied as shown below:

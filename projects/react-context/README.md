A Treehouse workshop where I learned how to use the React Context API to make passing data to components in my React app more efficient and manageable. Before the workshop, I had experienced the challenges of prop drilling, where I had to manually pass props at every level, making the process tedious and error-prone.

The workshop covered to use the built-in Context API to manage application state in a more scalable and predictable way. I discovered that libraries like Redux and Recoil were not always necessary, as the Context API provided a way to pass data to components without having to pass props manually at every level.

Throughout the workshop, I learned how to identify where it's best to use context, initialize a new context, and implement the API into my React project. By the end of the workshop, I had gained a solid understanding of how to use the Context API to efficiently manage and pass data to all the components of my React app.

Overall, the workshop was a great learning experience, and I now feel more confident in using the Context API to streamline the data flow in my React projects.

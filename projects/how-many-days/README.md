# Time Calculator

This project is a simple time calculator web application that allows users to determine how long ago a specific date was in days, weeks, months, or years. The goal of this project was to practice JavaScript date manipulation and provide a user-friendly way to calculate time differences.

## Features
- Allows users to select a date from a date picker
- Users can choose the desired unit of time (days, weeks, months, or years)
- Calculates the time difference between the chosen date and the current date
- Displays the result in a user-friendly format


## Learning Outcomes
Building this project helped me to:

- Manipulate JavaScript Date objects and perform calculations based on them
- Use conditional rendering based on user input
- Implement a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS
- Handle user events and update the UI accordingly

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://ash1eygrace.github.io/practice/projects/how-many-days/)
2. Select a date from the date picker
3. Choose the desired unit of time (days, weeks, months, or years) from the dropdown menu
4. Click on the "Calculate" button

The result will be displayed below the button, showing how long ago the selected date was in the chosen unit of time

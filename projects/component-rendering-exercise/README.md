## About this Project

This project involved practicing JSX and leveraging the power of React and had us working with an array of objects to extract relevant data to pass through components and display them on the screen dynamically. 

Example of components and the data they're generated from:

## Learning outcomes

- To iterate over data using map(), this project provides an opportunity to develop one's skills in JavaScript, particularly in array manipulation and iteration.
- To understand data flow through props in React and build a solid foundation for building more extensive and flexible apps that handle complex data and user interactions. 

## Tools used

## The Objective:

The instructions given for this project where: 

```
// =============================================================
//   EXAMPLE OF GIVEN DATA:
// =============================================================

const planets = [
  {
    id: '1',
    name: 'Mercury',
    diameter: '3,031.67 mi',
    moons: 'none',
    desc: 'Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. Due to its proximity, it\'s not easily seen except during twilight. For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis. Up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun.',
    url: 'img/mercury.jpg' 
  },
  {
    etc... 
  },


// =============================================================
//   WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW
// =============================================================

// 1: Create a 'Planet' component that renders a planet card


// 2: Create a container component that iterates over the planets array 
//    and renders a 'Planet' component for each object in the array 


// 3: Render the container component to the DOM

```

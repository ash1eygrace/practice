This project demonstrates the use of React Router for routing and navigation. In this app, we've covered the following concepts:

- Creating and navigaging between routes with React Router, styling active links using NavLinks, created descendant and nesting routing, 
- Creating a 404-like route using the * wildcard in the Route component.
- Refactoring code to create a reusable component that renders data dynamically.
- Declaring dynamic routes using special URL parameters and accessing them using the useParams hook.
- Navigating routes programmatically using the useNavigate hook.

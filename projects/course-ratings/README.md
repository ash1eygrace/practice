# React Course Cards with Star Ratings

This project is a simple React application that displays course cards and allows users to rate them using star ratings. The goal of this project was to practice using React state and provide a simple example of how to use it in a real-world scenario.

## Features

- Display 6 course cards from an array of data 
- Allow users to rate courses using star ratings (1-5 stars)
- Update the rating when a user selects a new star rating
- Remove the rating when a user clicks on the selected rating

## Learning outcome

Building this project taught me how to use React state in a real-world scenario. Through creating a simple course card application with star ratings, I learned how to:

- Use the useState hook to manage state in a React component
- Update state based on user interactions (i.e., when a user clicks on a star rating)
- Render the UI based on the current state (i.e., displaying the selected star rating)
- Get familiar with React DevTools for debugging and understanding how state is changing over time.

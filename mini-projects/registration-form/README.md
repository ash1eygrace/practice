## About this Project

This project is a fully responsive registration form with client-side validation. Client-side validation is excellent for UX; However, since JavaScript can be disabled and bypassed, validation and sanitization must happen serverside to protect the database from malicious injections . That said, this project aimed to build fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and security.
